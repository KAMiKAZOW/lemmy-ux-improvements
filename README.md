# Lemmy UX Improvements

A Violentmonkey/Greasemonkey _User Script_ for `Lemmy.world` and `Lemmy.ml` UX Improvements.

This is a handy Violentmonkey script that makes some subtle yet effective adjustments to Lemmyâ€™s user interface.

## What it does

1. **Open thumbnail links in a new tab**: Ever click on a thumbnail link only to find yourself navigating away from the page? With this script, thumbnail links will automatically open in a new tab, allowing you to explore without losing your place.

2. **Quick access to communities you moderate**: If you are a moderator of any communities, you'll appreciate this feature. This script adds a list of the communities you moderate right below your profile link in the top-right menu. No more digging through your profile page to manage the communities you love. A single click takes you straight to your community page.

These improvements are designed to make your Lemmy experience smoother and more enjoyable. To take advantage of these features, all you need to do is install the script through the Violentmonkey extension.
